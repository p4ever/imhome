# imhome
I always told myself that I should find a way to automatically launch some applications that require bandwidth from my computer when I left home.
The purpose of this software should exactly be that one, when you left home, and some device comes with you (ex. your smartphone)
the software recognize that missing, and launches some application.

Right now you have no choise than launch at first mipony, then if no downloads start, imhome will replace it with utorrent.
Of course as soon as you are back home it closes the running app, so that your bandwidth is free for you.
